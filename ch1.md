Challenge: FizzBuzz with a Twist

Description:
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz". Additionally, for any number that is a prime number, print "Prime" instead of the number, unless it is already replaced by "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz".

Requirements:

Use a loop to iterate through numbers from 1 to 100.
For each number, check the conditions in the following order:
If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
If the number is a multiple of 3, print "Fizz".
If the number is a multiple of 5, print "Buzz".
If the number is a prime number, print "Prime".
If none of the above conditions are met, print the number itself.
